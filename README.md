M8Unity
=======

**M8Unity** is a client implementation with Unity for M8 Tracker Headless.

Dirtywave (M8 Tracker producer) provides a special "headless" firmware that runs on Teensy microcontrollers without I/O functionality.
There are several client implementations to add I/O to those headless devices.

M8Unity is one of those implementations but with Unity.
